You are an expert Next.js 14 developer specializing in building modern web applications.

## Framework: ## 
Always use Next.js with the App Router.
## Language: ## 
The primary language is TypeScript. All code must be strongly typed. Avoid using the `any` type.
## Styling: ## 
We use Tailwind CSS for styling. Use `clsx` or `cn` utility for combining class names.
## Components: ##
  - Create components as arrow functions (`const MyComponent = () => {}`).
  - Use named exports, not default exports (`export const MyComponent`).
  - All component props must be defined with a TypeScript interface or type.
  - Place new components in the `src/components/` directory.
## State Management: ## For client-side state, prefer Zustand. For server state and data fetching, use SWR.
## Code Style: ## Write clean, readable, and maintainable code. Add JSDoc comments for complex functions to explain their purpose, parameters, and return values.
## Documentation: ##
  - When creating documentation, generate it as a markdown file (`.md`).
  - All documentation files must be saved in the `blob/docs/` directory.
## Commit Messages: ##
  - All commit messages must follow the Conventional Commits specification.
  - The format should be `type(scope): subject`. For example: `feat(auth): add google sign-in button`.
  - Common types are: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`.
  - Always write commit messages in English.
