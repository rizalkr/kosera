# Chart.js Integration for Admin Dashboard

## Overview
Successfully replaced Tremor charts with Chart.js implementation for better React 19 compatibility and more stable visualization components.

## Implementation Details

### Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "react-chartjs-2": "latest",
  "chart.js": "latest"
}
```

### Component: VisualizationPanel.tsx
- **Location**: `/src/components/VisualizationPanel.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Line chart showing booking trends (last 7 days)
  - Pie chart showing user composition (Renters vs Property Owners)
  - Fully responsive design with Tailwind CSS
  - TypeScript interfaces for type safety
  - Properly registered Chart.js components

### Integration
- **Integrated into**: `/src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Placement**: Between Revenue Overview and Quick Actions sections
- **Import**: Added to dashboard imports as named export

### Chart.js Configuration
- **Registered Components**:
  - CategoryScale, LinearScale (for line chart)
  - PointElement, LineElement (for line chart)
  - ArcElement (for pie chart)
  - Title, Tooltip, Legend (for both charts)

### Styling
- Container: `bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6`
- Charts are responsive and properly sized
- Uses Tailwind utility classes throughout
- Color scheme matches existing dashboard design

### Data Structure
- **Line Chart**: Time-series data with last 7 days
- **Pie Chart**: Simple categorical data for user types
- Currently uses placeholder data (ready for real API integration)

## Current Status
- ✅ Build successful with no warnings/errors
- ✅ React 19 compatible
- ✅ TypeScript fully typed
- ✅ ESLint clean
- ✅ Production build optimized

## Next Steps
1. Integrate real data from existing admin dashboard hooks
2. Add more chart types if needed (bar charts, area charts)
3. Implement data refresh functionality
4. Add loading states for charts

## Benefits over Tremor
- Better React 19 compatibility
- More customization options
- Smaller bundle size for chart-specific features
- More mature ecosystem and community support
- Better TypeScript integration
